# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Visualizer

A **Java GUI-based project** that simulates and visualizes multiple CPU scheduling algorithms.  
This project was developed as part of an **Operating Systems course** assignment to help demonstrate how different CPU schedulers operate and affect process execution order and waiting time.

## 🧠 Features

- Graphical User Interface built with Java Swing
- Visual and step-by-step simulation of:
  - **FCFS (First-Come First-Served)**
  - **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
  - **Round Robin**
  - **Non-Preemptive Priority**
  - **Preemptive Priority**
- Displays key metrics like:
  - Gantt chart
  - Average waiting time
  - Turnaround time
  - CPU utilization

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (for GUI)
- NetBeans (optional for building/running)

## 📚 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/sujoy146/CPU-Scheduler.git
   cd CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms


2. Compile and run the application:

   * Using an IDE (like **NetBeans** or **IntelliJ**)
   * Or from terminal:


     javac src/schedulermain/*.java
     java schedulermain.SchedulerMain


> Make sure you have Java 8+ installed.
